## Process

Rebuilding this site from the Internet Archive Copy of it. It was previously hosted on Squarespace, but with hosting fees being high and the content no longer being edited, it makes sense to host this a static site using Astro. I initially wanted to rebuild the complicated header structure, but in the end realised it made sense to use Starlight as a template. Since the site is mostly text based, this approach makes sense.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
