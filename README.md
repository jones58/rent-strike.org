# Rent-strike.org

## Process

Rebuilding this site from an [Internet Archive Copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20211101134325/https://www.rent-strike.org/). It was previously hosted on Squarespace, but with hosting fees being high and the content no longer being edited, it makes sense to host this a static site using Astro. I initially wanted to rebuild the complicated header structure, but in the end realised it made sense to use Starlight as a template to structure the whole site. Since the site is mostly text based, this approach makes sense and will allow fast implementation.

## TODO

- just grab md files for every page from internet archive copy using [this tool](https://web2md.answer.ai/)
- Fix broken src links on live site (see vercel preview). work out how to link properly.
- connect up domain in vercel
- display sidebar items in custom order, rather than alphabetical (mirror old site)
- add welcome page or welcome/how to use this site bits to the why we strike doc (homepage/ index.mdx)
- better alt text throughout, like on action! page
- maybe edit on github like on knowledge wiki
- aesthetics link
- about this site page
- seo

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
