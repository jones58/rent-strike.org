### Pre-Spring 2015 Background

In 2015 a rent strike is launched at Campbell / Hawkridge House at UCL over poor conditions and ongoing building works in the halls.

After the campaign at Campbell / Hawkridge House breaks for the summer, activists involved in that campaign start planning with others to launch a “Cut The Rent” campaign at UCL to protest and reduce rents which had been rapidly increased and that the university was making over £16 million profit from. Plans are made, research is done and activists prepare for a big launch at the start of the new academic year in September 2015.

## Spring 2015

- UCL Cut The Rent launches petition, gathers 1000 signatures and hands in all signatures printed out in a flash occupation of the vice-provost’s office.

## September- December 2015

- UCL CTR activists win the positions of Halls Accommodation Officer and External Accommodation Officer on the UCL Union council.

- Campbell House East and Hawkridge House hearings, Nov 2015 former residents get compensated big bucks (just under £500,000) -- story is covered fairly extensively

- UCL CTR does softer actions, including

  - a petition that gets 1,300 signatures (https://www.change.org/p/university-college-london-the-rent-is-too-damn-high)

  - Banner drop and small demo in the UCL main quad.

  - A “live-in” is done in the last week of term outside the provost’s office

- More canvassing, decide to focus on building rent strike in January in Max Rayne, the cheapest UCL halls for a single room.

## January 2016

- Article gets published in The Guardian online, gets 36,000 shares and 2,600 comments. https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/25/london-students-refuse-to-pay-rent-and-demand-40-cut

- UCL CTR calls for a national demonstration, titled “NO TO CENSORSHIP | VICTORY to MAX RAYNE RENT STRIKE!”. The demo ended up blocking off Tottenham Court Road, and culminated in the burning of an effigy of the Vice-Provost of Operations, Rex Knight, in the middle of Euston Circus at rush hour.
